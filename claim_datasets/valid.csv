Created in 1982 largely by the party establishment, the superdelegate was to serve as a safeguard to ensure a populous candidate did not take the nomination, and keep the Democrats out of the White House. This election more than any prior, proves no one can say what a populous candidate might be able to do once they get to the presidential debate stage. Polls show if Bernie Sanders were allowed to run as the Democratic nominee, he would do quite well against Donald Trump.   Superdelegates are largely comprised of party establishment, according to NBC News  Superdelegates are unpledged delegates to the Democratic convention, meaning that they aren’t beholden to the results from the primaries and the caucuses (the way pledged delegates are). They are, for the most part, current and former Democratic politicians. They make up 15 percent of all delegates (714 out of 4,765) — down from 20 percent in 2008. And they are free to support the presidential candidate of their choice at the convention. According to NBC News’ latest count 4/11/2016, Clinton leads Sanders in superdelegates, 460-38.     Focusing in and looking at a state like New Hampshire, we can clearly see how superdelegates have effected this race. At the polls Bernie Sanders won New Hampshire’s pledged delegates by a landslide 22 percent. Bernie Sanders received 60.4 percent of the poll vote, just about 150,000 votes. Clinton received 38 percent of the poll vote, tallying just about 95,000 votes. Yet, all six Democratic New Hampshire superdelegates gave their support to Hillary Clinton, effectively erasing Sanders win, leading both candidates to leave the state with the same 15 delegates. The six votes of support by Governor Maggie Hassan, Representative Ann Kuster, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, and DNC members Bill Shaheen, Kathy Sullivan, and Joanne Dowdell, effectively erased the impact of 55,000 Democratic voters on this election.",,,Would Bernie Sanders won the 2016 democrat nomination without Super Delegates?,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-super-delegates-decid_b_10098414

This means that every time you relocate to a different state you’ll be required to re-register on their database as well as become subject to that state’s laws regarding sex offenders. Restricted residency. Most states prohibit sex offenders from living within a certain distance of gathering places for children such as parks, schools, daycare centers, and playgrounds. As a result, it may be difficult to find housing that meets all of your requirements while also taking your personal needs into account. Restricted employment. In addition to housing restrictions, most states also limit where a sex offender can work. For instance, anywhere near the following places may be restricted: schools, clothing stores (with changing rooms), salons or spas, as well as in positions of power over someone else (doctor, psychiatrist, etc.). Loss of child custody. No matter what your conviction was for, if registered as a sex offender your ex can use the registration as a reason to deny you custody of your children, stating that you may be a danger to your own child. Decreased privacy. Since the registry is meant to keep tabs on past offenders, privacy is extremely limited. Bias, prejudice, and intolerance. Once convicted and registered, family, friends, and acquaintances may view you as a threat or at the very least an outcast.

An estimated 12,000 Nepalese children, mainly girls, are trafficked for sexual commercial exploitation each year within Nepal or to brothels in India and other countries.[4] Some 84 % of girls in prostitution interviewed in Tanzania reported having been battered, raped or tortured by police officers and sungu sungu (local community guards). At least 60% had no permanent place to live. Some of these girls started out as child domestic workers. [4] UNICEF estimates that there are 60,000 child prostitutes in the Philippines and many of the 200 brothels in the notorious Angeles City offer children for sex.[8] In El Salvador, one-third of the sexually exploited children between 14 and 17 years of age are boys. The median age for entering into prostitution among all children interviewed was 13 years. They worked on average five days per week, although nearly 10% reported that they worked seven days a week. [4] In Vietnam, family poverty, low family education and family dysfunction were found to be primary causes for CSEC. Sixteen per cent of the children interviewed were illiterate, 38 % had only primary-level schooling. Sixty-six per cent said that tuition and school fees were beyond the means of their families. [4] In Sri Lanka, children often become the prey of sexual exploiters through friends and relatives.

False registrations: Voting under fraudulent voter registrations that either use a phony name and a real or fake address or claim residence in a particular jurisdiction where the registered voter does not actually live and is not entitled to vote.   Duplicate voting: Registering in multiple locations and voting in the same election in more than one jurisdiction or state.   Fraudulent use of absentee ballots: Requesting absentee ballots and voting without the knowledge of the actual voter; or obtaining the absentee ballot from a voter and either filling it in directly and forging the voter’s signature or illegally telling the voter who to vote for.   Buying votes: Paying voters to cast either an in-person or absentee ballot for a particular candidate.   Illegal “assistance” at the polls: Forcing or intimidating voters—particularly the elderly, disabled, illiterate, and those for whom English is a second language—to vote for particular candidates while supposedly providing them with “assistance.”   Ineligible voting: Illegal registration and voting by individuals who are not U.S. citizens, are convicted felons, or are otherwise not eligible to vote.   Altering the vote count: Changing the actual vote count either in a precinct or at the central location where votes are counted.   Ballot petition fraud: Forging the signatures of registered voters on the ballot petitions that must be filed with election officials in some states for a candidate or issue to be listed on the official ballot.",,,In what ways does voter fraud happen?,https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/heritage-explains/voter-fraud

And as of this spring, fewer city residents were jobless than at any other time in at least three decades.  So there’s good news on the jobs front that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel could reasonably tout. Instead, he is now clinging to a variation of a boast we rated as False when we first heard him utter it in January.  Back then, he declared Chicago in 2017 enjoyed the “highest employment in the private sector in the history of the city.” His revised variation narrows the comparison by more than a century and no longer explicitly confines it to workers in the private sector.  “Chicago is experiencing right now the highest employment since 1950,” Emanuel declared recently during a public television interview on WTTW’s “Chicago Tonight” program. A few minutes later in the interview, he repeated the point to underscore how attractive the city has become to employers.   Is Emanuel now on more solid ground with his amended jobs claim than when we checked him early this year? We decided to take a second look.  A numbers game Emanuel didn’t explain the basis for his new claim. We sought clarification from a mayoral spokesman, but he did not provide it.  But, in a nutshell, the answer to our question is no. State and federal headcounters conduct different jobs tallies, but none render numbers that match the superlatives uttered by the mayor either now or in January.  Underlying our skepticism of Emanuel’s initial claim was an obvious demographic reality: Chicago’s population has been shrinking for decades and, at 2.7 million residents, is 900,000 fewer than its 1950 peak recorded by the Census.  Early this year, an Emanuel spokesman said the mayor’s numbers came from an annual report from the Illinois Department of Employment Security. That report does not tally jobs held by Chicago residents, but rather private-sector jobs located in the city held by Chicagoans and suburbanites alike.  For 2017, that report showed 1.18 million private-sector jobs in the city, the highest number reported by the state since 1990 when it recorded 1.2 million private-sector jobs for Chicago. But the report series dates back to the late 1950s, and for most years prior to 1990, the city’s private-sector jobs count far exceeded its 2017 tally.",,,Rahm Emanuel: Chicago is experiencing right now the highest employment since 1950.,https://www.bettergov.org/news/fact-check-emanuel-wrong-again-on-chicago-jobs

It is the principal reason ObamaCare has caused overall premiums to double in just four years. Community rating literally penalizes quality coverage for the sick… ObamaCare is community rating.

The Washington Post Fact Checker tells us that since his first day in office, President Trump has made 324 false or misleading statements about healthcare (at least as of 10/10/2018). He has also created vast uncertainty in health insurance markets with other sabotage attempts. Here are some examples:  The Trump Administration has refused to commit to making cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments and failed to commit to enforcing the individual mandate, putting the integrity of the risk pool and affordability of coverage in jeopardy. Trump’s obvious attempts to manufacture a crisis caused uncertainty in the marketplace and prompted insurers to sharply increase premiums for the upcoming plan year, or pull out altogether.  By another executive order in October, Trump allowed associations to offer group insurance plans with skimpy benefits and offer lower cost plans to members nationally across state lines. Trump’s order allows association health plans to be exempted from core Obamacare requirements like coverage of essential health benefits. The “essential” ACA health benefits include hospital care, prescription drugs, maternity care, and mental health. The aim was to broaden the risk pool by preventing insurers from offering cheap plans tailored to young and healthy customers at the expense of older and sicker people. Experts worry this executive order will damage ACA exchangers and result in overall higher costs.  Trump wants to make it easier for businesses to require employees to pay for their own insurance using reimbursements. He also wants to open more loopholes for people to buy insurance outside of ACA markets, attracting younger and healthier people away from current markets. Experts think this will destabilize Obamacare by leaving behind a smaller insurance pool of older and sicker people, resulting in fewer insurers and higher premiums.  Trump’s executive order finally terminates CSR subsidies paid to insurance companies to help people between 100% and 250% of the poverty level pay for the insurance and health care they get through ACA exchanges. Ironically, Trump’s constant threats to terminate CSR subsidies caused uncertainty in insurance markets that exacerbated two problems he blamed on Obamacare – namely, high premiums and the exit of insurers. This intentional sabotage will harm the 7.1 million people, or 58% of Obamacare enrollees, who qualified for subsidies this year.  Signing up for insurance under Obamacare will be a lot harder this year. Trump has shortened the annual open-enrollment period (Now Nov.1 to Dec.15) and announced plans to take HealthCare.gov offline for 12 hours at a time during peek enrollment times, “for maintenance.” He also cut ACA enrollment advertising by 90% and cut funding for Navigator groups who help people navigate the complex enrollment process and pick a plan under the ACA exchanges or Medicaid.",,,"Did Republicans sabotage the Affordable Care Act, resulting in more uninsured people?",https://www.mhealthtalk.com/sabotage/

Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq,” Trump tweeted. “Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good! We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning.”  Shortly after 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Iran launched more than a dozen ballistic missiles against U.S. military and coalition forces in Iraq. It was not immediately clear if any U.S. service members were hurt in the strikes.  The reassuring tone of Trump’s tweet marked an unexpected shift away from the harsh rhetoric the president has used in recent days to characterize tensions with Iran, which escalated following a U.S. strike that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.Hours before the Tuesday night attacks, Trump told reporters at the White House that “if Iran does anything that they shouldn’t be doing, they’re going to be suffering the consequences and very strongly.”  Trump also said the United States was “totally prepared” for Iran to retaliate, and “we’re prepared to attack if we have to as retribution.”  U.S. stock futures plunged on Tuesday night on news of the Iranian offensive.  Trump spent part of Tuesday night meeting with top advisers at the White House about the attacks, including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Army Gen. Mark Milley.  Both the Pentagon and the Iranian government were unequivocal about who was behind the attacks. “It is clear that these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi military bases hosting U.S. military and coalition personnel at Al-Assad and Irbil,” a Pentagon spokesman said soon after the attacks.  Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said in a tweet late Tuesday that Iran “took & concluded proportionate measures in self-defense.”  Zarif added, “We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression.”",,,how has donald trump responded to the iraq war?,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/trump-responds-to-iranian-attacks-on-us-forces.html
