You go to your local FFL (that’s Federal Firearm License) dealer. 2. You pick out the firearm you wish to purchase legally, provided you are of legal age (18 for a rifle/shotgun, 21 for a handgun). 3. Fill out the ATF Form 4473, being sure to answer every question truthfully. 4. Provide 4473 and government issued identification to the FFL. 5. The FFL submits your information in your 4473 along with the type of firearm (rifle/shotgun or handgun, nothing more specific than that is sent) into the NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System). 6. In anywhere from 30seconds to several hours, (I’ve seen wait times to process exceed 30 hours), the FFL will receive one of 3 responses back. 6a. The first response is an approval. This means you can buy the firearm. 6b. The second response is an explicit deny. This means you have something in your background history (felony, domestic violence, drugs, adjudicated mentally deficient) that prevents you from purchasing a firearm. Typically, this kind of deny also sends police officers to the location you are buying from because it’s a crime to attempt to purchase a firearm as a prohibited person. 6c. The third response is a delay. This is a response that simply means they can’t issue an approve or deny immediately and it requires more investigation. This is more likely if you have a common name (John Smith) or if you have a fairly unique name, but happen to share it with someone with a criminal history in the same city/state as where you live. The trick with this one is the 72 hour rule. If, after 3 days (72 hours) the NICS has not come back with an explicit deny, then the FFL is to assume the check is passed and can sell the firearm. 7. Upon passing (or exceeding the 3 day delay period), your dealer will escort you to the cash register to ring up the purchase. Upon completing the purchase, they escort you to the exit doors and you take the firearm home.  As I said, this is all that is needed to obtain one in most states. Some states such as Illinois issues Firearm Owner ID cards, which is required before even looking at a gun. Other states, such as Florida, who conducts NICS checks on concealed carry permit applications, will accept a concealed carry permit in lieu of running an actual NICS check.  Colorado, where I live, has their own background check system as well ran by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. So when they submit your 4473, not only does it run through the federal NICS, but it runs through the state CBI as well.",,,When someone tries to buy a gun what procedures are followed?,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-correct-procedure-to-purchase-a-gun

Presumptive nominee In United States presidential elections, the presumptive nominee is a presidential candidate who is assumed to be their party's nominee, but has not yet been formally nominated or elected by their political party at the party's nominating convention.[3][4] Ordinarily, a candidate becomes the presumptive nominee of their party when their ""last serious challenger drops out""[5] or when the candidate ""mathematically clinches—whichever comes first. But there is still room for interpretation.""[6] A candidate mathematically clinches a nomination by securing a simple majority (i.e., more than 50 percent) of delegates through the primaries and caucuses prior to the convention.[3][4] The time at which news organizations begin to refer to a candidate as the ""presumptive nominee"" varies from election to election.[6] The shift in media usage from ""front-runner"" to ""presumptive nominee"" is considered a significant change for a campaign.[6]  In the modern era, it is the norm for the major political parties' nominees to be ""clear well before the conventions"";[4] in the past, however, some conventions have begun with the outcome in doubt, requiring multiple rounds of balloting to select a nominee.[7] The last conventions with more than one ballot for president occurred in 1952 for the Democrats and 1948 for the Republicans.[7]",,,Who determines the presidential nominee?,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee

The measure would enact the biggest changes to the U.S. retirement system since 2006. The goal by the bill’s backers is to get it attached to “must-pass” legislation that bubbles up before Congress heads home in late December for the holiday recess — and before an election year that might be dominated early on by an impeachment trial in the Senate. Despite the partisan noise swirling around the impeachment hearings in Washington, D.C., supporters of at least one bill remain hopeful that the divide won’t derail its passage.  The Secure Act, as the measure is called, aims to increase the ranks of retirement savers and the amount they put away. While it cleared the House in May with broad backing from both sides of the aisle — the vote was 417 to 3 — the bill remains stalled in the Senate.  “Retirement has always been an issue with bipartisan support, and it still is,” said Paul Richman, chief government and political affairs officer at the Insured Retirement Institute, which is one of many groups — both industry and consumer — that support the legislation.",,,What would happen if Mendoza went against the bipartisan bill presented to increase the tax rate?,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/this-bill-to-improve-your-retirement-is-stuck-in-congress.html

FACEBOOK TWITTER LINKEDIN By J.B. MAVERICK  Updated Aug 27, 2019 TABLE OF CONTENTS The Circular Flow of Income Real Flows Versus Money Flows The Real Versus Money Economy Money flow and real flow are the two main aspects of the circular flow of income economic model. Both refer to exchanges of goods and services for money, but the two concepts differ in how they refer to the opposite sides of these exchanges as they relate to individuals and companies.   Real flows refer to the flow of the actual goods or services, while money flows refer to the payments for the services (wages, for example) or consumption payments.   KEY TAKEAWAYS Money flows depict the way that money and credit circulate in the economy as income turns into savings and investment and back again. Real flows depict the way that commodities and products & services are produced and consumed in the economy. While mainstream economists often discount the relation between real and money flows, many others understand that the two are intrinsically linked. The Circular Flow of Income In a modern exchange economy, one in which all economic exchanges involve money, the circular flow of income model attempts to depict the back and forth flows of money and services between individuals (or households) and companies.

Registration with the United Nations.  2. Interview with the United Nations.  3. Refugee status granted by the United Nations.  4. Referral for resettlement in the United States.  The United Nations decides if the person fits the definition of a refugee and whether to refer the person to the United States or to another country for resettlement. Only the most vulnerable are referred, accounting for less than than 1 percent of refugees worldwide. Some people spend years waiting in refugee camps.  5. Interview with State Department contractors.   6. First background check.  7. Higher-level background check for some.  8. Another background check.  The refugee’s name is run through law enforcement and intelligence databases for terrorist or criminal history. Some go through a higher-level clearance before they can continue. A third background check was introduced in 2008 for Iraqis but has since been expanded to all refugees ages 14 to 65.  9. First fingerprint screening; photo taken.  10. Second fingerprint screening.  11. Third fingerprint screening.  The refugee’s fingerprints are screened against F.B.I. and Homeland Security databases, which contain watch list information and past immigration encounters, including if the refugee previously applied for a visa at a United States embassy. Fingerprints are also checked against those collected by the Defense Department during operations in Iraq.  12. Case reviewed at United States immigration headquarters. 13. Some cases referred for additional review. Syrian applicants must undergo these two additional steps. Each is reviewed by a United States Citizenship and Immigration Services refugee specialist. Cases with “national security indicators” are given to the Homeland Security Department’s fraud detection unit.  14. Extensive, in-person interview with Homeland Security officer.  Most of the interviews with Syrians have been done in Jordan and Turkey.  15. Homeland Security approval is required.  16. Screening for contagious diseases.  17. Cultural orientation class.  18. Matched with an American resettlement agency.  19. Multi-agency security check before leaving for the United States.

The INA allows the United States to grant up to 675,000 permanent immigrant visas each year across various visa categories. On top of those 675,000 visas, the INA sets no limit on the annual admission of U.S. citizens’ spouses, parents, and children under the age of 21. In addition, each year the president is required to consult with Congress and set an annual number of refugees to be admitted to the United States through the U.S. Refugee Resettlement Process.   Once a person obtains an immigrant visa and comes to the United States, they become a lawful permanent resident (LPR). In some circumstances, noncitizens already inside the United States can obtain LPR status through a process known as “adjustment of status.” Lawful permanent residents are foreign nationals who are permitted to work and live lawfully and permanently in the United States. LPRs are eligible to apply for nearly all jobs (i.e., jobs not legitimately restricted to U.S. citizens) and can remain in the country permanently, even if they are unemployed. After residing in the United States for five years (or three years in some circumstances), LPRs are eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship. It is impossible to apply for citizenship through the normal process without first becoming an LPR. Each year the United States also admits a variety of noncitizens on a temporary basis. Such “non-immigrant” visas are granted to everyone from tourists to foreign students to temporary workers permitted to remain in the U.S. for years. While certain employment-based visas are subject to annual caps, other non-immigrant visas (including tourist and student visas) have no numerical limits and can be granted to anyone who satisfies the criteria for obtaining the visa.",,,United States immigration policy,https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/how-united-states-immigration-system-works

Rockefeller Jr. explained it in 1927, there was once a time when it made sense for society not to expect students to pay much for college: most of the students were going into the ministry, or into some other low-paying but society-benefiting career, so it behooved the nation to keep costs low by supplementing funds with endowments and gifts from men like Rockefeller himself. That had changed by the early 20th century, when more men (and a few women) were going to college, many of them in preparation for their future high-earning careers, or simply because it was becoming more normal. Why, the reasoning went, shouldn’t they pay more?  If they couldn’t afford it, Rockefeller suggested a system of student loans that sounds pretty nice today. “For those students who could not meet these higher costs scholarships and student aid would need to be used with increasing liberality, and student loan funds provided on a large scale,” he declared. “For most students other than those who go into the ministry or teaching, a loan either with or without interest, with the first payment date possibly ten years after graduation, would meet the situation and not prove an undue burden.” (His detractors cautioned, however, that such a system would make college the domain of the wealthy.)",,,What is the history of paying for college in the US?,https://time.com/4472261/college-cost-history/

It’s worth noting, however, that the inflation-adjusted numbers could be declining at some points for several reasons, and not just because teachers are being paid less. For example, it’s possible that many veteran teachers left the state, and the average teacher became less experienced.  That may explain why, if you compare the salary schedules from 2008 and 2018, many pay levels are actually much higher for teachers now than then, even when adjusted for inflation.

This is important if the country has a large current account deficit due to a lack of competitiveness. Higher exports and aggregate demand (AD) can lead to higher rates of economic growth. Devaluation is a less damaging way to restore competitiveness than ‘internal devaluation‘. Internal devaluation relies on deflationary policies to reduce prices by reducing aggregate demand.

News consumption is expected to increase as U.S. audiences turn to their preferred networks for updates on the coronavirus pandemic, and in fact Fox News averaged 3.54 million primetime viewers in the week running from March 9 to 15, 2020.   Performing well during the mid-evening prime time slot on cable television is the goal of any network that takes its ratings seriously. News networks Fox, CNN and MSNBC are engaged in a monthly battle to hit the top spot during prime time and draw in the most viewers during those precious evening hours.   What is prime time? Prime time television is the time at which the audience peaks, and in the United States usually takes place between 8pm and 11pm. TV networks show their most sought after or successful programs during this time, and this slot is where advertisers like to spend their money in order to maximize the amount of viewers who will see their products. Programs such as Hannity and The Rachel Maddow Show which debate news coverage from a particular point of view draw in massive audiences each month, and contribute to the overall ratings of the network they belong to.   Why do ratings matter? Ratings are important to TV networks because they are linked to advertising rates, and rising or falling ratings can affect what an advertiser will pay to secure a spot. They are used by networks to determine their position compared to competitors.

Not long after Pyongyang sentenced him to 15 years of hard labor, Warmbier fell into a coma; he died in the United States on June 19, 2017, six days after North Korea released him. “You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world,” Trump said to the nation and to Warmbier’s family, who sat in the audience. Trump then introduced 34-year-old North Korean Ji Seong Ho, who survived torture, starvation, and a crippling train accident before defecting in 2006.

We found 15 of the 22 right-to-work states were among the top 25 states in job growth. North Dakota, which Gingrich hailed during the CNN debate, had the largest increase during that time span, 19.5 percent. The four states with the greatest decrease were all Rust Belt states that have relied on manufacturing: Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana. None of those are right-to-work states. Georgia had the fifth lowest private sector job growth rate.  We also analyzed private-sector job growth since June 2009, which federal officials said was the end of the recent economic recession. North Dakota, again, was at the head of the class and Texas, another right-to-work state, was second. Thirteen of the 22 right-to-work states were among the top 25 states in job growth. Four of the five states with the lowest private-sector job growth rates were not right-to-work states.  Nine of the nation’s 10 fastest-growing states over the past decade were right-to-work states. Five of those states — Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, Texas and Utah — had increases in job growth since April 2001. The population growth in those states may be a factor.
